Basic AS3 demo for F5 BIG-IP

This is a basic demo showing how to use the Application Services 3 (AS3) extension on F5 BIG-IP.

AS3 provides a declarative API in which you specify a desired configuration end-state via a JSON declaration.

Here I'll provide a video demo using Postman to configure BIG-IP and also make simple changes to the configuration using AS3.
